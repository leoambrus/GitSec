Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the HandshakeResult method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-10401."
