        "GitHub_Advisory_Database": "TeamViewer Desktop for Windows before 15.8.3 does not properly quote its custom URI handlers. A malicious website could launch TeamViewer with arbitrary parameters, as demonstrated by a teamviewer10: --play URL. An attacker could force a victim to send an NTLM authentication request and either relay the request or capture the hash for offline password cracking. This affects teamviewer10, teamviewer8, teamviewerapi, tvchat1, tvcontrol1, tvfiletransfer1, tvjoinv8, tvpresent1, tvsendfile1, tvsqcustomer1, tvsqsupport1, tvvideocall1, and tvvpn1. The issue is fixed in 8.0.258861, 9.0.258860, 10.0.258873, 11.0.258870, 12.0.258869, 13.2.36220, 14.2.56676, 14.7.48350, and 15.8.3."
