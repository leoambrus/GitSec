        "GitHub_Advisory_Database": "A vulnerability in IPv6 traffic processing of Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family Wireless Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Layer 2 (L2) loop in a configured VLAN, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition for that VLAN. The vulnerability is due to a logic error when processing specific link-local IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet that would flow inbound through the wired interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause traffic drops in the affected VLAN, thus triggering the DoS condition."
