Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of MAC addresses by the tdpServer endpoint. A crafted TCP message can write stack pointers to the stack. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the root user. Was ZDI-CAN-12306."
