The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by importing a crafted XML file with malicious entries, which could allow the attacker to read files within the affected application. Versions prior to 4.4(0.26) are affected."
