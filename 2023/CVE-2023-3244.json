This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to reset the plugin's settings. NOTE: After attempting to contact the developer with no response, and reporting this to the WordPress plugin's team 30 days ago we are disclosing this issue as it still is not updated."
