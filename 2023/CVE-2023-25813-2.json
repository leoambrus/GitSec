    "details": {
        "GitHub_Advisory_Database": "### Impact\n\nThe SQL injection exploit is related to replacements. Here is such an example: \n\nIn the following query, some parameters are passed through replacements, and some are passed directly through the `where` option.\n\n```typescript\nUser.findAll({\n  where: or(\n    literal('soundex(\"firstName\") = soundex(:firstName)'),\n    { lastName: lastName },\n  ),\n  replacements: { firstName },\n})\n```\n\nThis is a very legitimate use case, but this query was vulnerable to SQL injection due to how Sequelize processed the query: Sequelize built a first query using the `where` option, then passed it over to `sequelize.query` which parsed the resulting SQL to inject all `:replacements`.\n\nIf the user passed values such as\n\n```json\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"OR true; DROP TABLE users;\",\n  \"lastName\": \":firstName\"\n}\n```\n\nSequelize would first generate this query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE soundex(\"firstName\") = soundex(:firstName) OR \"lastName\" = ':firstName'\n```\n\nThen would inject replacements in it, which resulted in this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE soundex(\"firstName\") = soundex('OR true; DROP TABLE users;') OR \"lastName\" = ''OR true; DROP TABLE users;''\n```\n\nAs you can see this resulted in arbitrary user-provided SQL being executed.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue was fixed in Sequelize 6.19.1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDo not use the `replacements` and the `where` option in the same query if you are not using Sequelize >= 6.19.1 \n\n### References\n\nSee this thread for more information: https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/14519\n\nSnyk: https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SEQUELIZE-2932027"
