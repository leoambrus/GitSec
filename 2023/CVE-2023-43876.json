The installer deletes all folders and files upon completion of installation. The vulnerability is valid, but because October's installer is not part of one of the GitHub Advisory Database's [supported ecosystems](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/README.md#supported-ecosystems), alerts cannot be sent out for the correct package.\n\n## Corrected Description\nA Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the installer of October CMS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts via a crafted payload injected into the dbhost field."
